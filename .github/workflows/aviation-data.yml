# Use this workflow IN the ReadbackCorrect repo (not ReadBack).
# 1. Copy this file to ReadbackCorrect as .github/workflows/aviation-data.yml
# 2. Copy the scripts/ folder from ReadBack into ReadbackCorrect (build_*.py, check_faa_cycle.py, build_all_and_update_manifest.sh)
# No PAT needed — the job pushes to the same repo using GITHUB_TOKEN.
